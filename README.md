| Analyzing Supermarket Database with SQL(https://github.com/raufh10/supermarket_data_analysis_sql) | EDA | In this SQL project, I analyzed a Chinese supermarket database to answer business questions such as the categorization of products by their loss rates, the calculation of month-over-month sales growth, and the identification of top-selling products within each category. While applying SQL concepts like basic queries, join operations, aggregation functions, and window functions, I aimed to uncover insights into sales trends, product performance, and category-level profitability. | [Sales Performance Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/SalesPerformanceDashboardv2_0/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) |
